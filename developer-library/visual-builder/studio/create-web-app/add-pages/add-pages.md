# Create Pages for a Web App

## Introduction

This lab shows you how to create web pages to display the business objects you created in the previous lab.


Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### About this Lab

Now that you've created the Location, Department, and Employee business objects, we'll see how to create web pages to display data from these business objects in your application. So far, you've only imported data for the Location object. You'll add data for the Department and Employee business objects in later labs, but set up the pages required to display that data in this lab. You'll create one page to display departments and another to display employees, both in table components. You'll also add a **Create** button to each page to let your users create a new department or a new employee (in other words, create new instances of the business object in the database).

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
* Add web pages to display data from business objects
* Add web pages to create new instances of a business object

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* A Chrome browser
* All previous labs successfully completed

## Task 1: Use the **main-start** page to display departments

Let's create a table to display your departments on the `main-start` page. The Table component is useful when you want to show lots of data in columns.

1.  Click **Web Applications** ![Web Applications icon](images/web-applications-icon.png) in the Navigator.
2.  If necessary, expand the **hrwebapp** and **main** nodes, then click **main-start**, the page that was automatically created as the default home page for your web application. (You can also open the page by clicking the **main-start** tab just below the header.) You're viewing the Page Designer.

    Click the **Web Applications** tab to close the Navigator pane and expand your work area. You can also widen your browser window.

3.  Let's give this `main-start` page a title. Click `main` on the page canvasâ€”notice how the title text uses the Bind Text component, also selected in the Structure view. (If you're having trouble selecting the component on the page, you'll need to expand the canvas area to view all elements.)

    ![](images/department-heading.png "This image shows the Page Designer tab for the main-start page, with the 'main' text featured in the Bind Text component selected on the canvas.")

4.  In the Bind Text component's Properties pane, replace `main` with `Departments` in the **Value** field.

    ![](images/departments.png "This image shows the Bind Text's Properties pane, with the Value  field set to Departments.")

5.  Now click **Components** to open the Components palette, scroll down to Collection, then drag and drop a **Table** component onto the canvas.

   ![](images/department-add-table.png "This image shows a Table component being dragged onto the page canvas.")

    A table with some sample data is added to the page. We'll use this table to display three columns that map to the department business object's id, name, and location fields.

6.  Select the table if necessary, then click **Add Data** in the Properties pane to open the Add Data Quick Start.

    ![](images/department-add-data-quick-start.png "This image shows part of the Quick Start menu for a new Table. The Add Data quick start is available for selection ")

    Quick Starts walk you through complex processes and help build the basics of your application quickly; in this task, we'll use the Add Data Quick Start to connect your table to the Department business object's data. The Quick Start wizard will prompt you to select your data source, select the fields from the business object that you want to show in your table, and filter data (which we won't do here).

7.  On the Locate Data step of the Add Data wizard, select **Department** under Business Objects, then click **Next**.  

    ![](images/department-add-data.png "This image shows part of the Locate Data page of the Add Data quick start. The Department business object is selected. ")

8.  On the Bind Data step, under item\[i\], select **id** and **name** (in that order).   

    ![](images/department-add-data-selectfields.png "This image shows the Bind Data page of the Add Data quick start. Under the item[i] check box, the id and name check boxes are selected. In the Columns list, the columns are id and name (the order in which the check boxes were selected). ")

9.  Expand the **locationObject** and **items** nodes (expand **item\[i\]** if it isn't already expanded) and select **name**. Because we created a reference from the Department business object to the Location business object in the previous lab, the location's name field is now available to us through the locationObject accessor, which lets us traverse relationships between the two objects. Click **Next**.

    ![](images/department-add-data-selectitemfields.png "This image shows part of the Bind Data page of the Add Data quick start after the locationObject node has been expanded. The items and item[i] nodes are expanded, and the name check box is selected. In the Columns list, name appears at the bottom of the list.")

10.  On the Define Query step, click **Finish**.  

    A Departments table with three empty columns is displayed on the `main-start` page. The second Name column (which maps to the location name field) shows simply as Name because that's what we set for the Display Field when we created the Location reference.

    ![](images/departments-table.png "This image shows three columns added to the Departments table: Id, Name, and Name.")

11.  To make the location name column more descriptive, click the **Data** tab in the Properties pane. Under **Table Columns**, click ![Column Detail icon](images/columndetail-icon.png) next to **Name (locationObject)**. You won't see the icon until you hover the mouse next to the field.  

    ![](images/department-table-location-name.png "This image shows the Data tab for the Table component. Under Table Columns, the Column Detail arrow is selected, allowing the label of the last Name column to be changed.")

12.  In the **Columns, Header Text** field, change `Name` to `Location`, then click ![Back to Table icon](images/backtotable-icon.png) **Table Columns** to return to the main **Data** tab.  

    ![](images/department-table-location-name-rename.png "This image shows part of the Column Detail tab for a table column. The Columns, Header Text field has been changed from Name to Location. The Table button is selected, to return to the main property inspector. ")

     The `main-start` page now has a table with three columns: Id, Name, and Location. You won't see any records in your table because we are yet to import data for the Department business object.

## Task 2: Add a page to create departments

Now that we have a way to show departments, we'll add a Create page that lets users create new departments. With the help of the Add Create Page Quick Start, we'll connect to our data source, the Department business object, and select the fields that we want the user to provide values for.

1.  With the Departments table on the `main-start` page selected, click **Quick Start**, then click **Add Create Page**.
2.  On the Select Endpoint step of the Add Create Page wizard, select **Department** under Business Objects (if necessary) and click **Next**.
3.  On the Page Detail step, select **location** (**name** is already selected because it's a required field). Name and Location are the only fields the user needs to specify to create a department.

   ![](images/department-add-create.png "This image shows the Page Detail page of the Add Create Page quick start. Under the request check box, the location and name check boxes are selected. The Button label field is set to Create. The Page title is Create Department, and the Page name is main-create-department.")
4.  Leave the Button label and other fields set to their default values. Click **Finish**.

    A **Create Department** button appears in a Toolbar component above the table on the `main-start` page. (You need to click next to the **Create Department** button to see the Toolbar component.) Click  **Web Applications** in the Navigator to see the `main-create-department` page created in the pages list under `main`.

    ![](images/department-add-create-result.png "This image shows the result of the Add Create Page quick start. The main-start page has a button with the label Create in a Toolbar component below the heading and above the table. In the Navigator, the main-create-department page has been added to the pages list under the main flow.")

5.  Let's quickly test whether we can create departments. In the hrwebapp's tree, click the **main-create-department** page to open it in the Page Designer.

    The page has a form for you to enter the fields you specified. It also has two buttons: Cancel and Save.

6.  In the Page Designer toolbar, click **Live** to make the form active. (Click **Properties** if you need to make room for the form.)

    To indicate that you are in Live mode, the **Live** option now has a green background, and a green line appears around the page.

7.  Enter `Administration` in the **Name** field, and select **Floor 1** from the **Location** list.

    ![](images/department-add-create-live.png "This image shows the use of the Create Department page when you run the application. Administration has been entered in the Name field, and Floor 1 has been selected from the Location list.")

    Click **Save**. A message appears briefly and you are taken to the application's Diagram tab, which displays the application's `main` flow and navigational relationships between pages in a flow.  

    ![](images/department-add-create-mainflow.png "This image shows the web application's main flow, with the main-start page pointing to the main-create-department page.")

    **Tip:** A page that's marked with a warning triangle usually indicates that the page's code has issues that you might want to review. For example, the warning for the `main-start` page here relates to a translation issue, which you can safely ignore. If you want, click **Audits** at the bottom of the screen to review and resolve issues in the Audits pane. You can also select messages that you don't want to be flagged and disable reporting for those messages in the page's Code view.

8.  Open the **main-start** page (you can either click the `main-start` tab just below the header or click the page in the Web Apps pane), then click **Reload page** ![Reload page icon](images/reload-icon.png) to see the row you created.

    ![](images/department-add-create-reload.png "This image shows the Departments page with the Create Department button and the table. The Reload Design Preview icon is selected. ")

9.  Click **Design** to return to Design view.

## Task 3: Add a page to display employees

We'll now create a page to display employees, similar to the one you created to show departments.

1.  In the Web Apps pane, under **hrwebapp**, click **+** (Create Page) next to the **main** node and select **Create Page**.

    ![](images/create-page.png "This image shows the web application with the main node expanded. The + sign is selected to select the Create Page option.")

2.  In the Create Page dialog box, enter `employees` in the **Page ID** field after the `main-` prefix and click **Create**.

    ![](images/employees-create-page.png "This image shows the Create Page dialog box, with main-employees entered in the Page ID field, and the Create button selected.")

    The `main-employees` page opens in the Page Designer.

3.  Click the **main-employees** Bind Text component on the page. Click **Properties** if necessary, then in the Properties pane, change `main employees` to `Employees` in the **Value** field.
4.  Now let's add a table to display employees. This time, instead of using the Components palette, let's use the Data palette, which provides a *data-first approach* where data sources serve as the starting point for your page design. To see this in action, click **Data** to open the Data palette, expand **Business Objects**, then the **Employee** business object.

    ![](images/data-palette-employee-object.png "This image shows the Data palette. The Employee business object under Business Objects is expanded to show its REST endpoints.")

  You'll see all the REST endpoints that VB Studio created when the Employee business object was created.

5. Drag and drop the **Get Many** REST endpoint (which fetches a list of employees) onto the canvas to bring up the **Render as** pop-up.

    ![](images/data-palette-employee-object-table.png "The image shows the Render as pop-up with the following options: Table Dynamic, List Dynamic, Table, and List. ")

6.  Select **Table** in the pop-up menu (the standard Table option, not Table Dynamic) to open the Add Data quick start.  This quick start is similar to the one you used before to create the departments table, except that you don't need to associate a data source.

7.  On the Bind Data step of the Add Data wizard, select **id**, **name**, **hireDate**, and **email** under item\[i\]. The columns appear in the order selected; if you want to change the order, drag a **Handle** icon ![Handle icon](images/handle-icon.png) to reorder the columns as desired.

    ![](images/employees-add-data-1.png "This image shows part of the Bind Data page of the Add Data quick start. Under the item[i] check box, the email, hireDate, id, and name check boxes are selected. In the Columns list, the id, name, hireDate, and email columns appear in the order in which the check boxes were selected.")

8.  Expand the **departmentObject** and **items** nodes (expand **item\[i\]** if it isn't already expanded) and select **name**, then click **Next**.

    ![](images/employees-add-data-2.png "This image shows part of the Bind Data page of the Add Data quick start after the departmentObject node has been expanded. The items and item[i] nodes are expanded, and the name check box is selected. In the Columns list, name appears at the bottom.")

9.  On the Define Query step, click **Finish**.

    An empty Employees table is displayed. If all the fields don't show, resize the table to see all fields.

10.  To make the second Name column (which refers to the Department name field) descriptive, click **Data** in the table's Properties pane. Under **Table Columns**, click ![Column Detail icon](images/columndetail-icon.png) next to **Name  (departmentObject)**.

    ![](images/employees-table-department-name.png "This image shows the Data tab for the Table component. Under Table Columns, the Column Detail arrow for the Name (departmentObject) is selected, allowing the label to be changed.")

11.  In the **Columns, Header Text** field, change `Name` to `Department`, then click ![Back to Table icon](images/backtotable-icon.png) **Table Columns** to return to the main **Data** tab.

     The `main-employees` page now has a table with five columns: Id, Name, Hire Date, Email, and Department. You won't see any information in the table until we import data for the Employee business object in a later lab.

     ![](images/employees-table.png "This image shows the Data tab for the Table component. Under Table Columns, the Column Detail arrow for the departmentObject is selected, allowing the label to be changed.")

## Task 4: Add a page to create employees

Add a Create page that lets your users create new employees.

1.  With the table selected on the `main-employees` page, click the **Quick Start** tab in the Properties pane, then click **Add Create Page**.
2.  On the Select Endpoint step of the Add Create Page wizard, select **Employee** under Business Objects (if necessary) and click **Next**.
3.  On the Page Detail step, select **hireDate**, **email**, and **department**, in that order (**name** is already selected because it's a required field).
4.  Leave the Button label field and other fields set to their default values. Click **Finish**.

    ![](images/employees-add-create.png "This image shows the Select Endpoint page of the Add Create Page quick start. Under request, the department, email, hireDate, and name check boxes are selected, and those fields are shown under Fields. The Button label field is set to Create Employee. The Page title is Create Employee, and the Page name is main-create-employee. ")

    A **Create Employee** button appears above the table, and the `main-create-employee` page appears in the pages list.

5.  In the pages list, click the **main-create-employee** page to open it in the Page Designer.
6.  Click within the form on the page but outside of a component (that is, in the Form Layout component on the page). In the **General** tab of the Form Layout's properties, set the **Max Columns** value to **2**.

    ![](images/employees-add-create-max-columns.png "This image shows the Form Layout component selected on the main-create-employee page. The Max Columns field in the General tab of the Properties pane is set to 2, so that the Name, Hire Date, Email, and Department fields show in two columns on the page.")

    The fields now appear in two columns. If you don't see the change, click **Properties** to hide the Properties pane and expand your view.

7.  Switch to **Live** mode. Enter `Leslie Smith` in the **Name** field. Select today's date from the **Hire Date** calendar, and enter `lsmith@example.com` in the **Email** field. Select `Administration` (the only choice) from the **Department** list. (You can use other data if you wish, except for Department, because you have only one department.) Click **Save**.  

    VB Studio briefly displays a message and then places you in the `main` page flow of your application.

    ![](images/employees-add-create-mainflow.png "This image shows the page flow for the web application's main flow. The main-employees page points to the main-create-employee page, and  the main-start page points to the main-create-department page.")

8.  Return to the `main-employees` page. (You can double-click the page tile in the page flow, in addition to using other navigation mechanisms.) Click **Reload page** ![Reload page icon](images/reload-icon.png) to display the row you created.
9.  Click **Code** (next to **Design** in the Page Designer toolbar) to view the HTML code for the `main-employees` page. You can see the code for the page title, the toolbar, and the table within `div` elements. You could edit this code to create a customized user interface. The components and classes all begin with `oj-`, indicating that they are Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET) components.  

    ![](images/employees-add-create-code.png "This image shows the HTML code for the main-employees page. ")

10.  Click **Design** to return to the `main-employees` page, then click **Structure** to view a hierarchical view of components on the page. Note how components that aren't visible on the page fade into the background, allowing you to focus on the visible parts of the page, a section at a time.

    ![](images/employees-add-create-structure.png "This image shows the component Structure of the main-employees page.")

11.  Click **Structure** again to close the Structure view.


## Task 5: Change the name of the **main-start** page

It makes sense at this point to change the name of the `main-start` page to `main-departments`, to match the name of the `main-employees` page.

1.  In the Web Apps pane, right-click the **main-start** page and select **Rename**.

    ![](images/main-start-rename.png "This image shows the hrwebapp and main nodes expanded in the Navigator. The options menu for the main-start page is open, and the Rename menu item is selected. ")

2.  In the Rename dialog box, replace `start` with `departments` in the **ID** field and click **Rename**.
3.  Click **main**. The page flow Diagram shows the now renamed page.

    ![](images/main-start-rename-mainflow.png "This image shows the page flow of the main flow after main-start has been renamed. The main-departments page still points to the main-create-department page, and the main-employees page points to the main-create-employee page. ")

4.  Double-click the **main-departments** tile to go to that page again.
5.  Although you have changed its name, the `main-departments` page will continue to be the page where your application starts when you run it. To find out why, click **Source** ![Source icon](images/sourceview-icon.png) in the Navigator. Under **webApps**, expand the **hrwebapp**, **flows**, and **main** nodes. Then click **main-flow.json** to open it.

    ![](images/mainflow-json.png "This image shows the Source view pane, with the webApps, hrwebapp, flows, and main nodes expanded. The main-flow.json file has been selected and is open. In it, the 'defaultPage' property is set to the value 'main-departments'.")

    You can see that the `defaultPage` property has been set to the value `main-departments`, making it the starting page for the web application flow. (If we'd looked before, it would have been set to `main-start`.)

    You may **proceed to the next lab**.
