# Oracle IAM 11.1.2.3 to 12.2.1.4 In-Place Upgrade

## Introduction

This section guides you through the steps to upgrade 11.1.2.3 LCM based OIM-OAM integrated environment with OUD as backend Directory Server &amp; OHS as webserver to 12.2.1.4.

*Estimated Lab Time*:  48-72 Hours

### About Oracle IAM Upgrade Strategies
An Oracle Identity and Access Management (IAM) deployment consists of a number of different components:
- A database
- An LDAP directory to store user information
- Oracle Access Manager for Authentication
- Oracle Identity Governance (formally Oracle Identity Manager) for provisioning
- Optionally, Oracle HTTP Server and Webgate securing access to Oracle Access Manager and Oracle Identity Governance

There are different upgrade strategies that you can employ for an upgrade of Oracle Internet Directory, Oracle Unified Directory, and Oracle Identity and Access Management. The strategy you choose will depend mainly on your business needs. This lab uses a Multi-hop in-place upgrade outlined in the Upgrade strategies document :
[Oracle IAM Upgrade Strategies](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/fusion-middleware/iamus/place-upgrade-strategies.html#GUID-9F906AE2-5BDF-426D-A97C-AC546ABFBD28)

The in-place upgrade allows you to take your existing deployment and upgrade it in place.
- When performing an upgrade, you should make as few changes as possible in each stage to ensure that the upgrade is successful.
- For example, it is not recommended to perform multiple upgrade activities such as upgrading Oracle Identity and Access Management, changing the directory, updating the operating system, and so on, all at the same time.
- If you want to perform such an upgrade, you must do it in stages. You must validate each stage before moving on to the next. The benefit of this approach is that it helps you to identify precisely where the issue occurred, and correct it or undo it before you continue the exercise.

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
* Become familiar with the in-place upgrade process for Oracle IAM 11.1.2.3 to Oracle IAM 12.2.1.4

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
- A Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- You have completed:
    - Lab: Prepare Setup (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
    - Lab: Environment Setup
    - Lab: Initialize Environment
- As part of pre-upgrade steps, customers have to delete any 10g agents in oamconsole. If they fail to do this UA readiness check will fail indicating presence of 10g agents. As part of pre-upgrade steps for OAM, delete any 10g agents in oamconsole.  UA readiness check will fail if 10g agents exist
- UA readiness check with fail at System Components Infrastructure with the error "OHS\_managed\_template.jar" missing. This can be ignored as we are not upgrading OHS

##  **STEP 1**: Upgrade IAM Components from 11.1.2.3 to 12.2.1.3

1. Upgrade OUD 11.1.2.3 to OUD 12.2.1.3

    - Add LimitRequestFieldSize 16380 to httpd.conf file after global server directive "KeepAlive"

4. Start OHS server

##  **STEP 5**: Validate the IAM 12.2.1.4 Integrated environment

1. Test OAM and OIG using the steps in *section 2.4.7* in the documentation below
    - [Functionally Testing the Access Manager and Oracle Identity Governance Integration](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/idm/suite/12.2.1.4/idmig/integrating-oracle-identity-governance-and-oracle-access-manager-using-ldap-connectors.html#GUID-3803AA41-A882-41C9-B1E8-0BBCBD581CE9)

2. Validate OAM:
    - Access [OAM Admin Server Console](http://wsidmhost.idm.oracle.com:7001/oamconsole) and login as *oamadmin*
        - Validates OAM Admin Server is functioning properly
    - Access [OAM Server Console](http://wsidmhost.idm.oracle.com:14100/oam/server/logout)
        - Validates OAM server is running and successfully listening in HTTP port
    - Access [OAM Server Console](http://wsidmhost.idm.oracle.com:7777/oam/server/logout)
        - Validates OHS proxy configuration to OAM server is working and also Webgate is functioning
    - Run ```Netstat -a -n | grep 5575```
        - It should return LISTEN
        - Validates OAM server is listening on OAP port

3. Validate OIG:
    - Access the Oracle Identity Governance pagees with the following URL:
        - [Oracle Identity Self Service](http://wsidmhost.idm.oracle.com:7778/identity)
        - [Oracle Identity System Administration](http://wsidmhost.idm.oracle.com:7778/sysadmin)
    - Verify the links for "Forgot Password", "Register New Account" and "Track User Registration" features appear in the login page and that they work.
    - Log in to [Oracle Identity Self Service](http://wsidmhost.idm.oracle.com:7778/identity) as *xelsysadm*
    - Create a new user
    - Logout as *xelsysadm* and login as the user created in *step 4*.
          - When prompted for login, provide valid credentials for the newly-created user.
    - Provide a new password and select three challenge question and answers.
          - The new user should now be logged in.
    - Verify the lock/disable feature works by opening a new private browser and logging in as a *xelsysadm*
          - Now lock or disable the user account created in step 4.
    - Now back in the broswer where the new user is logged try clicking on any new links, user should be redirected back to the login page.
    - Verify the SSO logout feature works by logging out Oracle Identity Self Service page where *xelsysadm* is still logged out.
          - Upon logout from the page, you are redirected to the SSO logout page.
