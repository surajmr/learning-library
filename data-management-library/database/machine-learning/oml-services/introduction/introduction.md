# Introduction to OML Services

REST interfaces have become popular for web application development as they provide a lightweight approach for interacting with HTTP data and services. Developers increasingly rely on REST endpoints to provide advanced analytics functionality in applications. Oracle's introduction of Oracle Machine Learning Services with Oracle Autonomous Database makes it easy for data science teams and application developers to manage and deploy machine learning models using a REST API for ease of application integration. As such, OML Services facilitates collaborations across the data science team.

Oracle Machine Learning (OML) in Oracle Autonomous Database provides access to in-database machine learning features. OML Services extends OML functionality to support model deployment and model lifecycle management for in-database OML models and third-party Open Neural Networks Exchange (ONNX) format machine learning models through REST APIs.

The REST API for Oracle Machine Learning Services provides REST API endpoints hosted on Oracle Autonomous Database. These endpoints allow you to store Machine Learning models and their metadata and create scoring endpoints for the model.
